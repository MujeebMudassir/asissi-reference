                When people start something with passion and not for mere
                commercial, it reflects in their work ethics...and with the team
                here...it is absolutely so. We just can't differentiate the
                commitment of the founder or the rest of the start, because the
                zeal with which the approach is the same. No differentiation
                factor at all. <br /> Their response during any kind of
                emergency situation is amazing.
